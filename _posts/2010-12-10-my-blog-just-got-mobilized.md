As you might remember from the [post Seeing through the religious fog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2010-11-08-seeing-through-the-religious-fog.md %}) I run this blog using the WordPress framework. Thereâ€™s a lot of nice stuff in the WordPress framework and one of those things is the plugin extensibility. So yesterday I installed a plugin called WPTouch that makes my WordPress blog look nicer in mobile devices.

You should try it surfing to my blog using a mobile device and tell me what you think.

Cheers!
