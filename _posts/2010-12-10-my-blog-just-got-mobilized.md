As you might remember from this [post](http://www.hugohaggmark.com/2010/11/08/seeing-through-the-religious-fog/ "Seeing through the religious fog") I run this blog using the WordPress framework. Thereâ€™s a lot of nice stuff&nbsp; in the WordPress framework and one of those things is the plugin extensibility. So yesterday I installed a plugin called WPTouch that makes my WordPress blog look nicer in mobile devices.

You should try it surfing to my blog using a mobile device and tell me what you think.

Cheers!

Hugo
