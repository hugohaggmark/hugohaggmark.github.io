I’ve had some customers come up to me and ask what the main differences are between running TFS portals on SharePoint Foundation and SharePoint Server (Enterprise Edition). If you use SharePoint Server Standard Edition you will have the same DashBoards as with SharePoint Foundation.

Luckily for me a former colleague of mine has written an excellent series concerning reporting in TFS 2010 [in "Reporting in Team Foundation Server 2010 – Part 1: Introduction"](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sunder/archive/2009/11/24/reporting-in-team-foundation-server-2010-part-1-introduction.aspx).

If you’re like me and want to cut to the chase here are the links:

- #### [Reporting in Team Foundation Server 2010 - Part 5: SharePoint Foundation Dashboard](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sunder/archive/2010/02/18/reporting-in-team-foundation-server-2010-part-5-sharepoint-foundation-dashboard.aspx "Reporting in Team Foundation Server 2010 - Part 5: SharePoint Foundation Dashboard")

##### Hope this makes it clearer,
