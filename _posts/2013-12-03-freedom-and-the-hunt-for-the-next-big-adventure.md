##

I finally got “released” last Friday (_ **as my former teammates would say** _) from a project with 2 years of coaching 20+ people in Spec By Example, Kanban, BDD, TDD, SpecFlow and lots more. I bring with me a lot of real life Spec By Example experience, some setbacks and some real success stories; more on that in future blog posts.

It feels really good to be sharing again,

Hugo
