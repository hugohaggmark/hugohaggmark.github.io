## Background
I joined Grafana Labs in January 2019 when the company was still relatively small, around 40 people. It's been an amazing, exciting and exhausting journey at times, but mostly fun. 
If you want to join a great, transparent, and fun company filled with great colleagues I highly recommend checking out [Grafana Labs careers page](https://grafana.com/about/careers). 

So why leave then Hugo? Well my reasons for leaving Grafana Labs are purely personal but are related to my curious personality. I'm very passionate about exploring new domains and learning new things so that made me take this step now. I'm not sure what my "next" thing will be but I'm curious to find out!

My last day at Grafana Labs will be the 25th of February.
