# Leaving Grafana Labs

## Background
I joined Grafana Labs in January 2019 when the company was still relativly small, around 40 people. It's been a amazing, wonderful and exhausting voyage at times, but mostly fun. 
If you want to join a great, transparent, and fun company filled with great colleagues I highly recommend checking out [Grafana Labs careers page](https://grafana.com/about/careers). 

So why leave then Hugo? Well my reasons for leaving Grafana Labs are purely personal but are related to my curious personality. I'm also passionate about exploring new domains and learning new things so that made me take this step now. I'm not sure what my "next" thing will be but I'm curious to find out!

My last day at Grafana Labs will be the 25th of Februrary.
