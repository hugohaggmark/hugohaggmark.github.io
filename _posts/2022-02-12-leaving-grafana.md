# Leaving Grafana Labs

## Background
I joined Grafana Labs in January 2019 when the company was still relativly small, around 40 people. It's been a amazing, wonderful and exhausting voyage at times, but mostly fun. 
If you want to join a great, transparent, and fun company filled with great colleagues I highly recommend checking out [Grafana Labs careers page](https://grafana.com/about/careers). 

So why leave then Hugo? Well my reasons for leaving Grafana Labs are purely personal but every so often I still ask my self if this is insane. 

In the end I'm a curious person who is passionate about learning new things so I figuered that it was time to try something brand new. Not sure what that is going to be right now but I'm sure I'll find something with time.
My last day at Grafana Labs will be the 25th of Februrary.
