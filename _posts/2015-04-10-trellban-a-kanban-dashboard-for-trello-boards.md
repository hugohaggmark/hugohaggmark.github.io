I've a lot of time between home and work every day because I live about 30 km from Stockholm in a suburb called Vallentuna.

That gives me about 1 hour of commute every day where I can sit with my laptop and hack stuff without disturbing anyone else.

I've been doing this for 1½ year since I've paused my usual "coach" consultant role and gone back to being a simple "web developer".  
Of course as I'm often the senior web developer in a team :) I tend to do some coaching anyway but not the type of coaching I used to do that is coaching entire teams.

OK, so since the end of November 2014 our team at Fritidsresor (TUI Nordic) has been doing this new cool thing called Mob Programming.  
That deserves a completely other blog post that I might write someday. (ooooh a cliffhanger)

Mob programming and the fact that one of our team members was going to work remotely made us switch from a physical Kanban board to Trello.  
Trello is really simple and nice but has one small drawback it doesn't come with any Kanban statistics in the box.

Our team coach did a lot of research in this area and didn't found any good free plugins for visualizing Kanban statistics from Trello.  
He did find Screenful (http://www.screenful.me/screenful-for-trello/) which is awesome but unfourtunately it isn't free.

So I got the idea to make this my new "while I'm commuting from and to work" project.

The project is called Fluxo&nbsp; ~~TrellBan~~ and is completely open source, you can find the source code at&nbsp;[https://github.com/hugohaggmark/Fluxo](https://github.com/hugohaggmark/Fluxo "Fluxo on GitHub")&nbsp;~~[https://github.com/hugohaggmark/TrellBan/](%20https://github.com/hugohaggmark/TrellBan/ "TrellBan source code")~~ and  
the lastest working release of TrellBan can be found at [http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/](http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/ "Fluxo")&nbsp;~~[http://trellban.herokuapp.com/](http://trellban.herokuapp.com/ "TrellBan Application")~~.

If you want to get at glimpse of what the dashboard actually looks like (with dummy data) you can see a demo at [http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/demo/](http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/demo/ "Fluxo Demo")&nbsp;~~[http://trellban.herokuapp.com/demo/](http://trellban.herokuapp.com/demo/ "TrellBan demo")~~.

I hope you enjoy Fluxo&nbsp; ~~TrellBan~~ ,
