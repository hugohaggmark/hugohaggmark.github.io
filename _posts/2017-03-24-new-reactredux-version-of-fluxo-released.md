I've been working since January on my way to and from work moving the old Fluxo version ([https://fluxo.herokuapp.com](https://fluxo.herokuapp.com)) to the React/Redux stack and today I'm very proud to announce that the new Fluxo version is deployed at [https://fluxo.hugohaggmark.com](https://fluxo.hugohaggmark.com).

I'll continue to make small improvments and I've some major features that I would like to add&nbsp;like:

- Cumulative Flow graph
- Apple and Android App

The old version will be permanently redirected to the new.

I hope you continue to enjoy Fluxo!
