When I quit my job at Aptitud in December 2016 I had no clue what I was going to do or where I was going to do it. I found myself in an endless world of opportunities and that kind of scared me a bit.

When I finally got my bearings back in early January 2017 (after a very relaxing Christmas vacation) I decided I would try my luck and post my CV at several job sites.

To my huge surprise It didn’t take more than a couple of days before I had whole January booked with interviews at interesting product companies in Stockholm area.

At first I kept a really open-minded approach to every opportunity and tried hard not to filter out any opportunity. But along the way some values came to stand out more than others:

- My next workplace should be a product company and not a consultant company.
- My next workplace should be on a journey, i.e. I wouldn’t want to come to a product company where everything is already done. Both organisational and technical.
- My next workplace should make the world a little better. Looking back at my professional life, had I contributed to any important difference to the world? Hardly, going forward this would have to change!

A couple of companies checked all my boxes but only one made it to the finish line.

The 27th of March 2017 I’m very happy and honoured to join [RaySearch Laboratories](http://www.raysearchlabs.com) as a Software Developer. ([http://www.raysearchlabs.com](http://www.raysearchlabs.com))
