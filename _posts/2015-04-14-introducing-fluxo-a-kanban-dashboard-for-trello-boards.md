Last week I introduced my latest "commute from and to work" project called TrellBan [here](http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/demo/).

So I received a very kind but to the point email from the Trello support team last night telling me that the name TrellBan was to close to Trello.

A bit surprised but at the same time somewhat flattered I began the hard work to come up with a really great new name for this open source project.

Fluxo means flow in portuguese (my mother tongue) and I think it is a short and easy enough name to remember.

So TrellBan is disontinued as of now and the replacement Fluxo is still an open source project that you can find here:

[https://github.com/hugohaggmark/Fluxo](https://github.com/hugohaggmark/Fluxo "Fluxo on GitHub")

The latest release of the Fluxo&nbsp;can be found here:

[http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/](http://fluxo.herokuapp.com/ "Fluxo")

And a demo of Fluxo can be found here:

Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused,
