You can never really prepare yourself for the arrival of your first child and even less so for the delivery of the same.

18 years ago, after 5 days at Danderyds sjukhus you where cut opened from your mother. She had tried every method ordinated by the doctor , even acupuncture, to deliver you the "natural" way.

That's your mom; a strong woman who never gives up and always gives everything for her children's best.

So when the doctor said you were gonna have to come out through a C-section we both got very emotional. I remember it was a mixed sense of defeat, relieve, happiness and when the doctor left our room we cried holding each other tight.

But all those emotions were blown away the very moment you arrived. When I hold you in my arms all I could feel was love and happiness.

I though as a parent you will learn your children &nbsp;everything you know but now I've learned it's the other way around. You've learnt me unconditional love, to be more relaxed, kindness, fairness and a lot of patience. You've given me so many wonderful moments with laughter, warmness, love and headaches sometimes.

I was merely a boy when you came and you made me into the man you hug every day.

For all this I'm very grateful, proud, happy and I hope there will be more wonderful moments ahead in your adulthood that we can share.

Some last words:

Be yourself, listen to your head but follow your heart. Be kind, have fun, laugh, cry, work hard to follow your dreams. Don't wait, do something amazing with your journey in life and make this world a better place, it sure needs it.

Mom and I'll be here right next to you when you need us.

Love you,

Mom & Dad
